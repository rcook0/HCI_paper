## UI Quality Gates
- [ ] Tokens rebuilt (`npm run build` in tokens-compiler) and committed
- [ ] Contrast AA passing for body/action text (attach `contrast_results.csv`)
- [ ] Screenshots updated; diffs reviewed for Light/Dark @ 100%/200%
- [ ] Access keys & Tab order unchanged or improved
- [ ] RTL/IME sanity check if layout touched
